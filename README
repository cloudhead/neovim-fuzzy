Fuzzy file finding for neovim, via fzy[1].

[1]: https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy

. Rationale

  To my knowledge, fzy delivers the best results out of all fuzzy finders,
  including fzf, ctrl-p, command-t and unite. This is due to the advanced scoring
  algorithm[2].

. Requirements

  * neovim >= 0.1.5
  * fzy
  * rg[1] or ag[2] >= 0.33.0

. Installation

  Install `fzy` via your package manager, or check https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy
  for instructions.

  If you're using vim-plug, add this to your vimrc:

      Plug 'cloudhead/neovim-fuzzy'

  You can also copy the contents of this directory into your .vim folder.

. Usage

  Add something like this to your vimrc:

      nnoremap <C-p> :FuzzyOpen<CR>

  Then hit <Ctrl-P> to open the finder. Hit <Enter> to jump to the selected file
  and <Esc> to close the pane. You may also navigate the file list with <Ctrl-N>
  and <Ctrl-P>. See the fzy documentation for the full list of key bindings.

  When no input is given, fuzzy shows the alternate buffer (also known as '#'),
  followed by other open buffers, followed by all other files.

  Fuzzy also lets you search within files, via the :FuzzyGrep command. You can
  use it on its own, or pass it an expression to search.

  Fuzzy also records most recently used file list. You can open the list via
  the :FuzzyMru command.
